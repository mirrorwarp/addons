This is the place where we maintain MirrorWarp-specific addon patches. This repository is only used for development purposes and is not intended to be useful on its own. Many of the addons will not work as a browser extension anymore due to some of the patches we have to make.

If you're forking MirrorWarp and want to make small changes to the addons, modify them directly in scratch-gui/src/addons. You don't need to and shouldn't fork this repository; it will just make things more difficult for you.
